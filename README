######## Future works to improve the API ########
1. The current REST API can be accessed by everyone. I will combine OAuth based login with the API in the future.
2. The current REST API does not support (find-grained) JSON object access control. For instance, user A is allowed to read user B's objects, but cannot update/delete them.  
3. The current API might be vulnerable to uid/parameters injection attack (which is similar to SQL injection attack). I will analyze and solve this problem in the future.
4. The REST API is running on a single AWS VM. I will make the service distributed, and store the JSON objects on distributed filesystem (e.g, GFS).
